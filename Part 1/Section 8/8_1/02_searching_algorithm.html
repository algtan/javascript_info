    // Which is the faster method to get 'glasses': pockets.glasses or head.glasses?
    // I assume head.glasses

    // According to the solution, there's no difference whether we take a property
    // from an object or its prototype. The modern engines remember where the proeprty
    // was found and reuse it in the next request.
