<!--
    If 'elem' - is an arbitrary DOM element node...
    1) Is it true that 'elem.lastChild.nextSibling' is always 'null'?
    TRUE
    2) Is it true that 'elem.children[0].previousSibling' is always 'null'?
    FALSE. children[0] will refer to the first ELEMENT, but not necessarily
    the first node. The first node may be a text node, which occurs before
    the first element.
